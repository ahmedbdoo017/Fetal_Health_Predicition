# **Fetal Health Prediction System**

## **Project Overview**
This project is designed to develop an AI-driven system that leverages **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** to monitor fetal health. The primary goal is to assist healthcare providers in early detection of complications, ultimately reducing both **child** and **maternal mortality rates**. The dataset contains **2,126 records**, categorized into three classes: **Normal**, **Suspect**, and **Pathological**, as determined by expert obstetricians. The application is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive interface for clinicians to analyze and interpret fetal health data.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project comprises features extracted from **CTG exams** to assess fetal health. These features include:
- **Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) patterns**
- **Fetal movements**
- **Uterine contractions**
- **Accelerations and decelerations**
- **Other key indicators of fetal well-being**

### **Classes**
- **Normal (Class 1):** Healthy fetal condition.
- **Suspect (Class 2):** Requires monitoring.
- **Pathological (Class 3):** Immediate medical attention needed.
